# PFB's Project_Euler
My solutions to problems posted on https://projecteuler.net/

This is not for cheaters. If you intend to solve the problems, don't look here.

Note that some solutions were written just for the purpose of getting an answer quickly, while others were intended to practice and improve my programming skills.

## Primes
A lot of problems refer to primes so I ended up writing a decent prime-number generator (See primegen.py). 

**I highly suggest you build your own source of primes**. It is a great way to practice coding! Begin with the brute-force version and try to make it faster. Once you're happy with your solution ...move to a library.
```buildoutcfg
pip install pyprimes
```

## Problems solved
See my progress at https://projecteuler.net/progress=eigenfield

You may notice this repo contains unsolved problems. This is my way of keeping track of my solutions (I had 40+ in college but lost them).

If you see any solved problem that doesn't have an associated #.py, I most likely solved it by hand.
